 * @brief       A GFRing (aka linear ring) is a closed line which should not be self intersecting.
 *
 * A GFRing is a GFLineString which is closed. The first and last coordinate in the ring
 * must be equal, and the interior of the ring must not self-intersect. A ring must have
 * either 0 or 4 or more GFPoints.  If these conditions are not met, the constructors
 * throw an IllegalArgumentException
